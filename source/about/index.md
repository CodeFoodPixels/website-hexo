![Me speaking at JSConf Budapest](/img/luke-bonaccorsi.jpg)

Hi, I'm Luke. I'm a 28 year old self-taught web developer/software engineer currently living near Leeds, UK and working for [Sky Betting & Gaming](https://www.skybetcareers.com/).

My expertise mainly lies in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including a myriad of frameworks for these technologies. On my personal projects I tend to use JavaScript on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), but I've also started experimenting with hardware using [Mongoose OS](https://mongoose-os.com/).

I organise and host the [LeedsJS](https://www.meetup.com/LeedsJS/) community group and have been the main organiser since April 2016. I have also spoken at a number of events and conferences.

Outside of tech, my other big passion is food and cooking. I enjoy trying different recipes and techniques, as well as learning to use new ingredients.

I also enjoy pixel art and will occasionally post pieces to Twitter.

## Speaking
I have spoken at a number of events and conferences. If you think I may be interested in a speaking opportunity, please get in contact using the methods at the bottom of this page.
