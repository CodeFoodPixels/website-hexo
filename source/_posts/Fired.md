Friday the 7th September 2012 was a bad day for me. That was the day that I was fired from my first development job. It was the beginning of a 7 month unemployment period where I asked myself some tough questions.

## The Lead Up
I'd been at the job for 15 months when I was fired and had spent a chunk of that time going through the disciplinary process for working too slow and not working to an expected quality.

Looking back, the situation was pretty ridiculous. I'd been hired as a junior developer (having never worked in the industry and having learned everything myself), I was expected to work on projects completely on my own (including testing my own work) and I was turned down whenever I asked for help. I'd stayed late evenings and weekends to work on projects, trying to get them finished and to the level of quality that was expected, but it didn't help.

Throughout the disciplinary process I was told that I needed to work faster and improve the quality of my work, but was never given the help I needed to do this.

Telling someone they're stuck in a hole isn't useful, offering them a ladder helps.

## The Aftermath
Immediately after being told I was fired, I collected my things and left. I couldn't face my now ex-coworkers and rushed my way through the office, out to my car and left.

On my way home, I stopped at a supermarket. The second I parked up and switched the engine off, I broke down and started crying. I'd fucked up, I was a failure.

When I finally got home, I told my housemate, friends and parents what had happened.  I felt super low and afterwards I just sat on the sofa, watched TV and ate junk food.

My friends helped me that evening, we hung out and got drunk. The support was hugely appreciated.
