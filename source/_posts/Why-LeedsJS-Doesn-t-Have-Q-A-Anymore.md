The day before April's LeedsJS meetup, I decided to try not having Q&A after the talks in favour of encouraging people to come and chat to the speakers directly. There were a variety of reasons as to why I felt that this would be the best route, and it seems to have been a success!

## Previous experiences

Before April's event, we'd always had Q&A after the talks. Over the 3 years that I've been involved in LeedsJS, I've experienced a few reoccurring issues with the Q&A part of the talks.

### The question designed to show off how much the asker knows

This is one of my least favourite things I've had happen. Someone asks a question but puts it in a way that is intended to try show that the asker knows more about the topic than the speaker.

This really sucks because the speaker has just given up a huge chunk of their time to share their knowledge and teach others. The asker has not and is basically stroking their own ego.

### "I have this specific problem with my code, fix it for me"

This is another one I really hate. The asker in this instance is basically asking the speaker to do work for them for free, on top of the work they had to do to prepare and deliver the talk.

What makes this worse for me is that it's likely that the asker came to the event with this question in mind, planning to ask the speaker to do this free work.

It's also disrespectful to the audience, they don't care about your specific code issues and they have no context for them anyway.

### "More of a statement than a question, but..."

I feel this is another example of the asker stroking their own ego. Rather than ask a question, the "asker" makes a statement, usually trying to correct something the speaker said or giving their opinion. To me this is hugely disrespectful, especially considering the time and effort that the speaker has put in.

### The question that's largely irrelevant to the talk

This usually happens when someone focuses on a small aspect of the talk that wasn't really relevant to the central point. It may be of interest to the asker, but isn't related to what the speaker wanted people to take away from the talk or even something that the speaker has an opinion about.

### The joke question

While most people like a joke, unfortunately people aren't very original when it comes to thinking one up. Often when there's a joke question about a talk, the speaker has heard it multiple times already. To them the humour has likely worn off and become tedious, especially if it's something related to them and not the talk.

### A decent chunk of the audience probably doesn't care
While there can still be good questions in a Q&A, it's still usually something that only a handful of your audience actually wants to know more about. The rest of your audience is becoming disengaged and just wants your event to progress. [The question that's largely irrelevant to the talk](#the-question-that's-largely-irrelevant-to-the-talk) also falls into this category.

## Additional factors

On top of the things I've seen happen before at LeedsJS, there are some things that I also see as areas where Q&A falls down or can be an issue. This stuff is either from my own experience as an organiser/speaker/attendee or what I've learned from others through discussions.

### The speaker is put on the spot

For some folks, being put on the spot to answer something that they've not been able to prepare for is anxiety-inducing and something that they want to avoid.

You may argue "you're expected to know this stuff" but I disagree, talks aren't only for experts. They're for sharing experiences and ideas, for inspiring folks to try something and for encouraging people to learn too. It's fine to not know the answer to a question, but being asked to admit this on stage in front of an audience is likely something that people want to avoid.

Similarly you may argue "you can't prepare for everything in life", but giving a talk is an already stressful situation that someone has spent a lot of time on preperation for. Adding a wildcard element into that is unnecessary extra stress.

### Conversations are more meaningful

In my experience the questions asked usually need some sort of back and forth to get an answer that both sides are happy with. This is really difficult to do when the speaker is on stage or at the front of the room and the asker is amongst a sea of faces.

Having a conversation allows the speaker and asker to be on the same page and get an answer that they're both happy with. On top of this, the speaker can ask other people questions when in a conversation situation, meaning that everyone can learn something.
