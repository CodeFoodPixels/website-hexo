The day before April's LeedsJS meetup, I decided to try not having Q&A after the talks in favour of encouraging people to come and chat to the speakers directly. There were a variety of reasons as to why I felt that this would be the best route, and it seems to have been a success!

## Previous experiences

Before April's event, we'd always had Q&A after the talks. Over the 3 years that I've been involved in LeedsJS, I've experienced a few reoccurring issues with the Q&A part of the talks.

### The question designed to show off how much the asker knows

This is one of my least favourite things I've had happen. Someone asks a question but puts it in a way that is intended to try show that the asker knows more about the topic than the speaker.

This really sucks because the speaker has just given up a huge chunk of their time to share their knowledge and teach others. The asker has not and is basically stroking their own ego.

### "I have this specific problem with my code, fix it for me"

This is another one I really hate. The asker in this instance is basically asking the speaker to do work for them for free, on top of the work they had to do to prepare and deliver the talk.

What makes this worse for me is that it's likely that the asker came to the event with this question in mind, planning to ask the speaker to do this free work.

It's also disrespectful to the audience, they don't care about your specific code issues and they have no context for them anyway.

### "More of a statement than a question, but..."

I feel this is another example of the asker stroking their own ego. Rather than ask a question, the "asker" makes a statement, usually trying to correct something the speaker said or giving their opinion. To me this is hugely disrespectful, especially considering the time and effort that the speaker has put in.

### A decent chunk of the audience probably doesn't care
While there can still be good questions in a Q&A, it's still usually something that only a handful of your audience actually wants to know more about. The rest of your audience is becoming disengaged and just wants your event to progress.
